Matrix factorisation is an important class of methods used in unsupervised [[image mass spectrometry]].

Typically these methods reduce the dimensionality of IMS data to easy computation and interpretation thereof. The decomposed data often presents as a set of trends that together describe the majority of the original data.

Colocalised and correlated data often becomes apparent and can thus be more easily interpreted by humans. It is also common to use these methods as pre-processing for further computational analysis.
